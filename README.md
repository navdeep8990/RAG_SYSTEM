# MultiRAG Source Retrieval

## Introduction

**MultiRAG Source Retrieval** is an AI-powered system that allows users to upload multiple sources, including **PDF files** or **web links**, and retrieve information from them using a chatbot interface. The system leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to enhance responses with factual accuracy by retrieving data from the uploaded sources before generating an answer.

## Setup Guide

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

To ensure smooth installation and avoid conflicts, create a virtual environment before installing dependencies.

#### **Windows**

```sh
python -m venv multiRAG_env
multiRAG_env\Scripts\activate
```

#### **macOS/Linux**

```sh
python3 -m venv multiRAG_env
source multiRAG_env/bin/activate
```

---

### 2. Install Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
